## Overview
This update enhances the anime viewing experience by making it easier for users to watch movies when they select a film. The changes include:

## Key Improvements

### 2. Anime Manager System
- Created a new JavaScript module (anime-manager.js) to handle anime selection and viewing
- Added dynamic content loading based on user selection
- Implemented localStorage to remember user selections

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Dynamic updating of page titles and breadcrumbs based on selected anime
- Automatic video source switching based on selected anime
